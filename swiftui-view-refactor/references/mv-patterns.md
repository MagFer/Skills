# Architecture Patterns Reference

## Preferred Approach: ViewModels Per App Section

Use ViewModels to organize and manage state for each major section of your app. This provides clear separation of concerns and makes complex state management more maintainable.

Key principles:
- **One ViewModel per app section**: Each major feature or screen should have its own ViewModel to manage its state and business logic.
- **Use `@Observable` for ViewModels**: Modern Swift Observation provides clean, efficient state management.
- **Initialize ViewModels in `init`**: Pass dependencies to the view via `init`, then create the ViewModel with those dependencies.
- **Make ViewModels non-optional**: Use `@State private var viewModel: SomeViewModel` instead of optional ViewModels.
- **Use protocol types for dependencies**: Inject services using protocol types (not concrete types) to enable testability and flexibility.
- **Inject services via `@Environment`**: Services and shared state should live in the environment and be passed to ViewModels.
- **Keep views declarative**: Views should focus on UI layout and delegate logic to the ViewModel.

Example pattern (Protocol-based dependency injection):

```swift
// Protocol definition
protocol DataServiceContract {
    func fetchItems() async throws -> [Item]
}

// Concrete implementation
final class DataService: DataServiceContract {
    func fetchItems() async throws -> [Item] {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// View
struct FeatureView: View {
    @State private var viewModel: FeatureViewModel

    init(dataService: DataServiceContract = DataService()) {
        _viewModel = State(initialValue: FeatureViewModel(dataService: dataService))
    }

    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.items) { item in
            ItemRow(item: item)
        }
        .task {
            await viewModel.loadData()
        }
    }
}

// ViewModel
@MainActor
@Observable
final class FeatureViewModel {
    private let dataService: DataServiceContract
    var items: [Item] = []
    var isLoading = false

    init(dataService: DataServiceContract) {
        self.dataService = dataService
    }

    func loadData() async {
        isLoading = true
        defer { isLoading = false }
        do {
            items = try await dataService.fetchItems()
        } catch {
            // Handle error
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits of protocol-based dependency injection**:
- ✅ Enables unit testing with mock implementations
- ✅ Decouples components from concrete implementations
- ✅ Maintains convenience with default concrete values in init
- ✅ Allows runtime substitution (for testing, feature flags, etc.)

**Critical reminder**: When refactoring to use protocol-based DI, always ensure the protocol contract includes **all methods** that clients will use. If a ViewModel uses multiple methods from a service (e.g., `fetchItems()`, `fetchItem(id:)`, `searchItems(query:)`), all of them must be declared in the protocol, not just a subset.

## Alternative Perspective: Pure MV Pattern

The following article presents an alternative view that favors keeping state directly in views. While this approach works for some projects, our preferred pattern uses ViewModels per section for better organization and testability.

# SwiftUI in 2025: Forget MVVM

*Let me tell you why*

It’s 2025, and I’m still getting asked the same question:

> “Where are your ViewModels?”

Every time I share this opinion or code from my open-source projects like my BlueSky client **IcySky**, or even the Medium iOS app, developers are surprised to see clean, simple views without a single ViewModel in sight.

Let me be clear:

You don’t need ViewModels in SwiftUI.
You never did.
You never will.

---

## The MVVM Trap

When SwiftUI launched in 2019, many developers brought their UIKit baggage with them. We were so used to the *Massive View Controller* problem that we immediately reached for MVVM as our savior.

But SwiftUI isn’t UIKit.

It was designed from the ground up with a different philosophy, highlighted in multiple WWDC sessions like:

- *Data Flow Through SwiftUI (WWDC19)*
- *Data Essentials in SwiftUI (WWDC20)*
- *Discover Observation in SwiftUI (WWDC23)*

Those sessions barely mention ViewModels.

Why? Because ViewModels are almost alien to SwiftUI’s data flow model.

SwiftUI views are **structs**, not classes. They are lightweight, disposable, and recreated frequently. Adding a ViewModel means fighting the framework’s core design.

---

## Views as Pure State Expressions

In my latest IcySky app, every view follows the same pattern I’ve advocated for years.

```swift
struct FeedView: View {

    @Environment(BlueSkyClient.self) private var client
    @Environment(AppTheme.self) private var theme

    enum ViewState {
        case loading
        case error(String)
        case loaded([Post])
    }

    @State private var viewState: ViewState = .loading
    @State private var isRefreshing = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                switch viewState {
                case .loading:
                    ProgressView("Loading feed...")
                        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                        .listRowSeparator(.hidden)

                case .error(let message):
                    ErrorStateView(
                        message: message,
                        retryAction: { await loadFeed() }
                    )
                    .listRowSeparator(.hidden)

                case .loaded(let posts):
                    ForEach(posts) { post in
                        PostRowView(post: post)
                            .listRowInsets(.init())
                    }
                }
            }
            .listStyle(.plain)
            .refreshable { await refreshFeed() }
            .task { await loadFeed() }
        }
    }
}
```

The state is defined inside the view, using an enum.

No ViewModel.
No indirection.
The view is a direct expression of state.

## The Magic of Environment

Instead of dependency injection through ViewModels, SwiftUI gives us @Environment.

```swift
@Environment(BlueSkyClient.self) private var client

private func loadFeed() async {
    do {
        let posts = try await client.getFeed()
        viewState = .loaded(posts)
    } catch {
        viewState = .error(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

Your services live in the environment, are testable in isolation, and encapsulate complexity.

The view orchestrates UI flow — nothing else.

Real-World Complexity
“This only works for simple apps.”

No.

IcySky handles authentication, complex feeds, navigation, and user interaction — without ViewModels.

The Medium iOS app (millions of users) is now mostly SwiftUI and uses very few ViewModels, most of them legacy from 2019.

For new features, we inject services into the environment and build lightweight views with local state.

Using `.task(id:)` and `.onChange()`

## SwiftUI’s modifiers act as small state reducers.

```swift
.task(id: searchText) {
    guard !searchText.isEmpty else { return }
    await searchFeed(query: searchText)
}
.onChange(of: isInSearch, initial: false) {
    guard !isInSearch else { return }
    Task { await fetchSuggestedFeed() }
}
```

Readable. Local. Explicit.

## App-Level Environment Setup

```swift
@main
struct IcySkyApp: App {

    @Environment(\.scenePhase) var scenePhase

    @State var client: BSkyClient?
    @State var auth: Auth = .init()
    @State var currentUser: CurrentUser?
    @State var router: AppRouter = .init(initialTab: .feed)

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            TabView(selection: $router.selectedTab) {
                if client != nil && currentUser != nil {
                    ForEach(AppTab.allCases) { tab in
                        AppTabRootView(tab: tab)
                            .tag(tab)
                            .toolbarVisibility(.hidden, for: .tabBar)
                    }
                } else {
                    ProgressView()
                        .containerRelativeFrame([.horizontal, .vertical])
                }
            }
            .environment(client)
            .environment(currentUser)
            .environment(auth)
            .environment(router)
        }
    }
}
```

All dependencies are injected once and available everywhere.

## SwiftData: The Perfect Example
SwiftData was built to work directly in views.

```swift
struct BookListView: View {

    @Query private var books: [Book]
    @Environment(\.modelContext) private var modelContext

    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(books) { book in
                BookRowView(book: book)
                    .swipeActions {
                        Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
                            modelContext.delete(book)
                        }
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now compare that to forcing a ViewModel:

```swift
@Observable
class BookListViewModel {
    private var modelContext: ModelContext
    var books: [Book] = []

    init(modelContext: ModelContext) {
        self.modelContext = modelContext
        fetchBooks()
    }

    func fetchBooks() {
        let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Book>()
        books = try! modelContext.fetch(descriptor)
    }
}
```

Manual fetching. Manual refresh. Boilerplate everywhere.

You’re fighting the framework.

## Testing Reality
Testing SwiftUI views provides minimal value.

Instead:

* Unit test services and business logic

* Test models and transformations

* Use SwiftUI previews for visual regression

* Use UI automation for E2E tests

* If needed, use `ViewInspector` for view introspection.

## The 2025 Reality

SwiftUI is mature:

* `@Observable`

* Better Environment

* Improved async & task lifecycle

* Almost everything you need lives inside the view.

I’ll reconsider ViewModels when Apple lets us access Environment outside views.

Until then, vanilla SwiftUI is the canon.

## Why This Matters

Every ViewModel adds:

* More complexity

* More objects to sync

* More indirection

* More cognitive overhead

SwiftUI gives you:

* `@State`

* `@Environment`

* `@Observable`

* Binding

Use them. Trust the framework.

## The Bottom Line
In 2025, there’s no excuse for cluttering SwiftUI apps with unnecessary ViewModels.

Let views be pure expressions of state.

Focus complexity where it belongs: services and business logic.

Goodbye MVVM 🚮
Long live the View 👑

Happy coding 🚀
